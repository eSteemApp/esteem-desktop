# eSteem Desktop

eSteem is stand-alone application that works on cross platforms. You can specify websocket to connect and start using without worrying to send your credentials to any server. Or being censored, disconnected.

You can also run Steem blockchain locally and connect through websocket specified in your configuration.

eSteem keeps your private keys locally and only uses it to sign transaction and ONLY transaction hash is broadcasted to specified websocket. Your keys never leave app, make sure to keep your PC secure.
